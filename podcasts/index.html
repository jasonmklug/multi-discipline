<h1>Recommended Podcasts</h1>

<p>I get a great many ideas from the insightful (and often entertaining) maker / developer / problem-solver podcasts to which I subscribe.  Give these a listen!</p>

<ul class="podcasts">
  {% assign podcasts = site.data.podcasts | sort:'sort_friendly_name' %}
  {% for podcast in podcasts %}
  <li class="podcast">
    <a href="{{ podcast.site_url }}" target="_blank">
      <img src="{{ podcast.artwork_image }}" class="podcast_art" alt="Podcast artwork for {{ podcast.name }}" />
    </a>
  </li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
