<h1>Recommended Podcasts</h1>

<p>I get a great many ideas from the insightful (and often entertaining) maker / developer / problem-solver podcasts to which I subscribe.  Give these a listen!</p>

<ul class="podcasts">
  {% assign podcasts = site.data.podcasts | sort:'sort_friendly_name' %}
  {% for podcast in podcasts %}
    {% include podcast_linked_art.html podcast=podcast %}
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
