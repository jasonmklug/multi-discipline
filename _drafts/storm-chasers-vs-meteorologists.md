title: Storm Chasers vs. Meteorologists

Watching on-the-ground-live-stream (*henceforth: "OTGLS"*) coverage of protest events in Ferguson last night, I found myself intrigued by this latest iteration of "eyewitness news".  It's thoroughly engaging on a human level, and *feels* unprocessed (and, therefore, closer to the Truth of the immediate situation).

In reality, though, I had to admit that I was experiencing a mediated version of the Truth (albeit much closer to the Truth in this incident than traditional news outlets have proven).

Though carried out dutifully and with the best of intentions, any OTGLS is hamstrung by the same tragic flaw as its less-nimble cable news counterpart: the need to sustain the attention of a fickle audience who has many entertainment options, and, therefore, pursue the flashiest or most exhillarating story angles.

In this way, the OTGLS is a storm chaser; bringing you exciting — often dangerously acquired — footage of an extreme event as it unfolds.

To be sure, there are times and places where storm chasers are necessary (and militarized police occupation of a small American town certainly fits the bill). In the long term, though, we need to be aware of our *greater* need, as a society, for meteorologists who do the less-glamorous work of studying the socio-political atmosphere around events to get us closer to the "why", "how", and "when" of these phenomena.

Meteorologists, in this metaphor, are the reporters covering boring — but understatedly significant — events like local town hall meetings or tedious congressional hearings.  Meteorologists gather atmospheric data on a continuous basis — roiling tornado or clear sky; militarized shock-and-awe or subdued schoolboard vote — doing the difficult work of parsing that data for answers and constructing models to better understand cause and effect.
