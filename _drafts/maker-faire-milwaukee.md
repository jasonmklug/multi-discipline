We brought the kids (ages 9, 5, and 2) to [Maker Faire Milwaukee](http://makerfairemilwaukee.com/) this weekend.  This was my first time attending a Maker Faire, so I had little context for what to expect. 

If I'm completely honest, I just hoped there'd be enough "kid stuff" to keep my children interested in sticking around so I could check out some 3D printers.
