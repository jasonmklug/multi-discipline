          Podcast Discovery & Recommendation
        </a>
      </h1>
    
      <span class="post_metadata">2014-11-10</span>
    
      <p>If you, like me, are widely curious and always trying to expose yourself to new ideas, you <em>ought to</em> consider the rise of podcasting as a medium to be nothing short of revolutionary.  For someone who carries an intense interest in a few subjects — and a passing interest in many, many more — the <em>right kind</em> of podcast can offer the caliber of insight that used to require tuition and a lecture hall (and often does so through hosts and guests with engaging personalities and an infectious passion for the subject matter).</p>

<p>I’ve posted <a href="/podcasts">the &quot;Maker&quot; subset of my podcasts subscriptions</a>.  That grid shows about 1/3 the <em>total</em> list of feeds through which <a href="https://overcast.fm">my podcatcher of choice</a> iterates every time it checks for new episodes (most of these podcasts post on a weekly schedule).</p>

<p>If it weren’t for the fact that writing code (or prose) requires focus from the same parts of the brain which process verbal language, I’d be actively keeping up with even more.  As such, my podcast consumption is limited —  quite literally — by the number of waking non-working hours in a day.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;So, ladies and gentleman, if I say I&#39;m an podcast fan, you&#39;ll agree.&quot;</em> -Me</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>The Problem</h2>

<p>There is a vast (and growing) landscape of podcasts available to any listener with the time and inclination to seek them out.  Most listeners, however, are <em>not</em> inclined to spend time perusing podcast directories for new must-listen shows; they have a few which suit their daily commute, and that’s as far into the landscape as they need to explore. (<a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/filthy-casual">Filthy casuals</a>.)</p>

<p>Or, approached from the &quot;recommender&quot; side: when one listener finds a show or episode they really like, they have limited outlets through which they can recommend it to other would-be listeners.</p>

<p>Speaking for myself: I <em>almost</em> always tweet a link to the feed and/or episode URL of a show which I find interesting, entertaining, or useful.  But I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if those recommendation tweets (given, as they are, in a stream-of-posts context which is impermanent by design and affords no immediate action for podcast listening or subscription) are lost on many who <em>would have</em> taken a listen, but weren&#39;t in a position to immediately:</p>

<ol>
<li>Stop what they were doing</li>
<li>Open their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_podcatchers">podcatcher</a></li>
<li>Find the show (or, if the podcatcher has no directory feature, copy/paste the show’s feed URL)</li>
<li>Subscribe to the show (or download the single episode)</li>
</ol>

<h2>The (Proposed) Solution</h2>

<p>A service which allows users to recommend single episodes of their favorite podcasts, and to “follow” the episode recommendations of other users, which the system compiles into a single appropriately formatted RSS/XML personal “followed” feed for each user.</p>

<p>As far as I can see, the best-fitting model already in existence is the humble <a href="https://support.twitter.com/articles/77606-faqs-about-retweets-rt">retweet</a>.</p>

<p>But, like the retweet — in order to enable that behavior, you first need a system to handle the basic re-share-able units of content (in our case, podcast episodes).</p>

<h3>Desired Behavior:</h3>

<ul>
<li>As a user, I “follow” other users whose podcast recommendations I think I’d find interesting (probably people whose interests I already know mirror my own, thanks to their presence on other social sites/services).</li>
<li>Individual episodes which have been recommended by users who I follow will be added to my “followed” feed.</li>
<li>Like retweets, even if more than one user who I follow recommends an episode, that episode is only added once to my “followed” feed.</li>
<li>When I want to expand my podcast horizons through a set of socially curated episode recommendations, I should be able to simply open my “followed” feed (which has all of the recommended individual episodes compiled into a single feed) in my podcatcher, and play an episode.</li>
<li>The rest of my subscriptions in that podcatcher should not be affected.</li>
<li>If I find an episode interesting enough that I want to subscribe to the podcast directly, there should be a button for doing just that on the individual episode’s “now playing” or “info” view.</li>
<li>If someone I follow adds a recommendation for a podcast to which I’m already subscribed, that episode should not appear in my “followed” feed.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Tools</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Web Site</strong> (acts as hub for creating an account, finding users to follow, recommending podcast episodes, etc.)</li>
<li><strong>API for Web Service</strong> (which the site and developers of podcatchers can use to authenticate service users, pass along episode [un]recommendations, add user’s “followed” feed as subscription, etc.)</li>
<li><strong>Cooperation of Developers</strong> (much in the way that third-party apps have integrated with useful &quot;personal collection&quot; services like <a href="https://pinboard.in">Pinboard</a> and <a href="https://www.instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a>)</li>
</ul>

<h2>The (Proposed) Process</h2>

<p>This remains to be seen, but I believe the first step would be to build an MVP of the website and service.  Obviously, it wouldn’t be <em>as</em> feature-rich on its own as it could eventually be once third-party podcatcher developers build integrations, but it would be a useful start for the steadfast core of Podcast Superfans&trade; who want to push and collect episode recommendations right away. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKie-vgUGdI">There are dozens of us... DOZENS!</a>)</p>

<p>Until third-party developers adopted it, service users could simply copy/paste the URL of their personal “followed” feed (<a href="http://www.kungfugrippe.com/post/20021002957/like-an-animal">LIKE AN ANIMAL</a>) to subscribe in any podcatcher, just like any other podcast feed.  They could also manually add/remove podcasts to/from an “I’m already subscribed” list on the system, to prevent recommended episodes of podcasts to which they’re already subscribed appearing in their “followed” feed.</p>

<p>These temporary workarounds would be tedious, but not sufficiently frequent to make use of the service into a chore.</p>

<h2>The (Expected) Outcome</h2>

<p>Since sharing recommendations is something done without any <em>real</em> expectation of return or interaction, it <em>shouldn’t</em> matter, at the outset, whether anyone is actually following you (meaning the inherent chicken-and-egg problem of social-dependent services <em>should</em> be avoidable).</p>

<p>And since podcasts, by their nature, require a time commitment to consume, a single-digit queue of recommendations is enough to keep a user busy for hours (unlike, say, Twitter — where a user must follow <em>at least</em> a few dozen other users to be ensured consistent fresh new content).  This means a user could conceivably fill their available podcast listening time by following just two or three recommenders.</p>

<p>Given the right circumstances (and eventual third-party developer integration) a service such as this could be expected to keep podcast listeners continually returning to the recommendation well for another quality dip of socially filtered podcast episodes.</p>

<p>It would be interesting to see how a recommendation machine constantly churning out high-quality content fares when it bumps up against the inherent limit to a human’s available daily (weekly, monthly) listening hours, and how that ultimately affects the decision users make about what to consume in their preciously limited time.</p>

      <span class="post_metadata">2014-10-16</span>
    
      <p>Despite having worked on and around the web since 2006, it&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve had my own personal space which I controlled soup to nuts.</p>

<p>Twitter has satisfied <em>most</em> of my <em>practical</em> publishing needs (low friction, low maintenance, publicly accessible, able to be individually hyperlinked), but the notion that I don&#39;t &quot;own&quot; my tweets is aggravating to my future-proofing sensibilities.</p>

<p>While I do have systems in place to capture, for example, my tweets (first via an iPhone app called <a href="http://www.momentoapp.com/%60%60">Momento</a>; more recently by running a custom install of Brett Terpstra&#39;s <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/projects/slogger/">Slogger</a> to add my tweets to a personal <a href="http://dayoneapp.com/">Day One</a> journal), it&#39;s not the same as having posts under my complete control.</p>

<h2>The Problem</h2>

<p>The fate of my posts to Twitter, Tumblr, or any other advertising-supported <em>&quot;post here and we&#39;ll probably keep your stuff around for a few years&quot;</em> platform is, ultimately, out of my hands.  But I <em>would</em> like most (if not all) of my day-to-day public writing to have the best possible chance of being around for my kids to discover when they&#39;re older.</p>

<h2>The Solution</h2>

<p>I&#39;m building out my own little corner of the web where I control the presentation, availability, and ultimate fate of my content, and which I can expand to include more forms of media (long-form posts, image galleries, video, audio, etc.) as I find uses for them.</p>

<h2>The Tools</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Static Site Generator</strong> (<a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>)</li>
<li><strong>VPS</strong> (<a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=896afa34ae98">DigitalOcean</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Web Server</strong> (<a href="http://nginx.org/">nginx</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Programming Language</strong> (<a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Templating Language</strong> (<a href="http://liquidmarkup.org/">Liquid</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Source Control</strong> (<a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a>)</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Process</h2>

<h3>Tinkering With Jekyll Locally</h3>

<p>Since I had never before used Jekyll, I limited myself to installing and running it locally on my development machine (a.k.a. &quot;dev machine&quot;, a.k.a. &quot;laptop&quot;) for a few days.  This gave me an opportunity to tinker with it (tweak a template, find the limits/hackability of the posting system, determine what else I could build into this) without investing a bunch of time spinning up a VPS.  Jekyll, I soon learned, could even be deployed to GitHub Pages with a few setup conformities, so that became my plan.</p>

<p>After tinkering with Jekyll, it was clear that while this was a solid piece of software out of the box, the <em>real</em> value it offered was its customizability and extensibility (given familiarity with Ruby and Liquid).  I work with Ruby professionally, so that was a good fit; and despite this being my first experiment with Liquid, it&#39;s a sufficiently intuitive and documented system that I picked it up quickly.</p>

<p>The Jekyll features I wanted to build, though, required that I change my deployment plan from <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> (which offers a free and quick way to run a stock Jekyll site) to deploying via Git to my own VPS.</p>

<h3>Setting Up My VPS</h3>

<p>Configuring the DigitalOcean Droplet (their term for a VPS &quot;unit&quot;) was straightforward; DigitalOcean&#39;s own system had me up and running with a virtual Linux (Ubuntu) &quot;box&quot; in no time, and I had the necessary user accounts, SSH Keys, etc. set up shortly thereafter (aided by <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/?refcode=896afa34ae98">DigitalOcean&#39;s excellent documentation &amp; tutorials</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> <em>Part of setting up this droplet involved directing web traffic from my domain name, multi-discipline.com, to my droplet&#39;s IP address.  In addition to being necessary for general web traffic, having that DNS <code>A Record</code> in place allowed me to use that hostname for other services (<code>ssh</code>, <code>git remote</code>, etc.) and have a single point of update should I move the site to a different server.</em></p>

<p>Next up, I installed Ruby and Jekyll on the VPS, installed Git (<code>git-core</code>, in my case), and created the Git repository at which I&#39;d be receiving my entire, un-compiled Jekyll site (pushed via Git from the repository on my laptop, where I&#39;m building the site and writing posts).</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> <em>Jekyll is a static site generator, meaning that the &quot;work&quot; of building each and every page in the site (setting the permalink address of each page; including header, footer and other page layout partials; replacing variables with the appropriate text, etc.) is done <strong>once</strong> whenever I push a change to the Git repository, instead of every time someone on the web requests a page.</em></p>

<p>The driving force of all that server-side processing is a Git <code>post-receive hook</code> on the site&#39;s repository (a.k.a. &quot;repo&quot;) on my VPS.  You can think of this as a shell script which fires when Git receives a change to that repo.  In basic terms (neglecting a few technical steps), that script:</p>

<ol>
<li>Tells Jekyll to turn my site&#39;s un-compiled content files, layout partials, and assets into a functioning and inter-linked set of web pages (in other words, makes the disparate parts into a proper web site).</li>
<li>Clones the generated <code>/site</code> folder to a particular directory on the VPS (where, in a future step, we&#39;ll tell the web server to look for the page files as they&#39;re requested).</li>
</ol>

<h3>Setting Up nginx As My Web Server</h3>

<p>While I&#39;ve done some basic system administration work in the past, I&#39;ve never actually installed and configured my own web server (nginx, in this case) on a clean system.</p>

<p>nginx does the work of listening for requests which come in, and serving the appropriate files from my VPS back to the web browser which requested them.</p>

<p>As such, I needed to let nginx know:</p>

<ul>
<li>The port on which it should be listening for web requests (standard is <code>80</code>)</li>
<li>The IP address from which it is serving (the IP address of my DigitalOcean Droplet)</li>
<li>Which site(s) I&#39;m serving, and which host name(s) I&#39;m using for them (<code>multi-discipline.com www.multi-discipline.com</code>)</li>
<li>Where (on the VPS) it should look for each site&#39;s &quot;root&quot; directory (eg. <code>/var/www</code>)</li>
<li>Which file to use as the site&#39;s (or any subdirectory&#39;s) index (typically <code>index.html</code>)</li>
<li>Which pages to use for given errors (eg. <code>404 /404.html</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p>I also needed to be sure the site configuration I did in <code>/sites-available/multi-discipline.com</code> was again expressed in that site&#39;s file in the <code>/sites-enabled</code> directory.  Since my setup is pretty straightforward (i.e. any site I have &quot;available&quot; should also be &quot;enabled&quot;), I symlinked the site file in <code>/sites-available</code> with its counterpart in <code>/sites-enabled</code>, meaning any future change to one of those files is carried through to the other.</p>

<h3>Temporary Hangups</h3>

<p>At this point, I ran into some system-permissions-related problems.</p>

<p>Firstoff, I&#39;d forgotten to make the <code>post-receive hook</code> file executable (i.e. &quot;able to be run&quot;), so nothing was happening when my Git repository detected changes.  I fixed this with a <code>chmod</code>.</p>

<p>Secondly, the <code>post-receive hook</code> script couldn&#39;t write in the destination folder (or, rather, a script <em>run by my user account</em> couldn&#39;t, but needed to, since the <code>git remote</code> named <code>droplet</code> set up on my laptop to push code to the VPS did so using my VPS user account&#39;s SSH Key), so I made my user account a member of the user group which has control over <code>/var/www</code> and its contents.  In my case (and, I believe, by default), this group was <code>www-data</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> <em>For security and peace-of-mind reasons, I set up a user account on my VPS which I would use for day-to-day system administration, but which <strong>was not</strong> the system&#39;s default <code>root</code> account, since <code>root</code> is basically god as far as the system is concerned, and can do many harmful things if accidentally or maliciously misused.</em></p>

<h2>The Outcome</h2>

<p>The first time I successfully ran <code>git push droplet master</code> on my development machine and found the properly compiled site being served at <a href="http://multi-discipline.com">http://multi-discipline.com</a>, I threw my arms up in victory.  Success!</p>

<p>From this point on, I have the ability (if not the time) to post lengthy screeds at will and trust they’ll be around until the day I no longer want them to be (or until my DigitalOcean payment method fails — whichever comes first).</p>
