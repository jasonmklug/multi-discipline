Dusting off the old weblog, after a _five-year_ absence 😅

The Jekyll site has been chugging along maintenance-free this whole time.  All I've
done is keep my DigitalOcean invoices paid.

I built this site and set up hosting two dev machines ago, though, so I had _completely_
forgotten how to publish.  The Multi-Discipline code had never even been on my current
machine (let alone appropriate `git remote`s and SSH keys set up, et cetera).

In trying to figure out how _past-me_ had set up the publishing flow,
my brain (clouded, unreliable 👎) was nudging me in the direction of popular Jekyll-based
hosting option [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), and I spent a few hours
trying to resurrect a publishing flow that never was.

But then I took a few minutes to read my own first post on this blog, [The Making of Multi-Discipline](/2014/10/16/the-making-of-multi-discipline/)
(clear, faithful 👍), and I was put back on the right track.  Documentation, FTW 🎉
(thanks, past-me)!

I set up a local `git remote` for the DigitalOcean droplet, did a test `push`
(which failed, so I wrangled some SSH keys and `push`ed again), and was back in business.

Since my attention was _momentarily_ back on Multi-Discipline, I took the time
to upgrade my trusty DigitalOcean droplet to the latest version of Ubuntu (`18.04`,
up from `14.4`) along with some other packages, and did some content/template housekeeping,
for good measure.

A quick tune-up, and everything seems ready to roll 😎👏
