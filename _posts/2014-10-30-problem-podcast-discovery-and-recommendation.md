## The Problem
There is a vast (and growing) landscape of podcasts available to any listener with the time and inclination to seek them out.  Most listeners, however, are *not* inclined to spend time perusing podcast directories for new must-listen shows.

Or, approached from the "recommender" side: when one podcast fan finds a show they really like, they have limited outlets through which to recommend that podcast to other would-be listeners.

Speaking for myself: I will *almost* always tweet a link to the feed and/or episode URL of a show which I think my followers would like.  But I wouldn't be surprised if those recommendation tweets (given, as they are, in a context which affords no immediate action for podcast listening/subscription) are lost on many who *would've* found the show useful or entertaining, but weren't in a position (for any number of reasons) to stop what they were doing, open their podcatcher, find the show, and download the episode or subscribe.
